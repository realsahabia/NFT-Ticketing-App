# Onchain Events

Onchain Events is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain for managing and selling event tickets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

## Features

- **Ticket Minting**: Users can mint event tickets by purchasing them with Ether (ETH).
- **Event Listing**: Admins can list new events by providing event details such as name, cost, date, time, and location.
- **User Authentication**: Users can connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the dApp to interact with it.
